# LIB Folder

All source inside this folder was grabbed from different source repositories
required by the chalk library. Copying the source was required for being able
to execute tests for the early days of the esm ecosystem.

It's a bit sad. It's also a bit sad that some libraries required have not 
even 10 lines.
